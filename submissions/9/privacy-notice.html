Data Transfers\r\nWe may transfer the personal data that we collect about you to recipients in countries other than the country in which the personal data originally was collected.

How Long We Keep Information\r\nThe time period for which we keep personal data depends on the purpose for which we collected it.

When we transfer your personal data to recipients in other countries (such as the U.S.), we will protect that personal data as described in this Notice.</p>
<p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;) or Switzerland, we will comply with applicable legal requirements providing adequate protection for the transfer of personal data to recipients in countries outside of the EEA and Switzerland. In all such cases, we will only transfer your personal data if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The country to which the personal data will be transferred has been granted a European Commission adequacy decision;</li>
<li>We have put in place appropriate safeguards in respect of the transfer, for example the EU Model Contracts.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />You may request a copy of the safeguards that we have put in place in respect of transfers of personal data by contacting us as described in the How To Contact Us section below.</p>
<p><strong>6. How Long We Keep Information</strong></p>
<p>The time period for which we keep personal data depends on the purpose for which we collected it. In all cases we keep it for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it. We will then delete the personal data, unless we are legally required to retain it or if we need to retain it in order to comply with our legal obligations (for example, for tax and accounting purposes).</p>
<p>Subject to any applicable legal requirements, we typically retain personal data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal data you provide to us when you make a purchase through our Site: we keep this personal data in order to process and deliver your purchase, and then we store it securely for seven years.</li>
<li>Personal data you provide when you sign-up to receive direct marketing communications: we keep most of this personal data for the duration of our relationship with you until you opt-out or until we do not have any contact with you for two years.</li>
